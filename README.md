HOW I APPROACHED THE PROJECT 
So after getting the project details,
I first had to break all the components down using a simple UI design in Figma.
After that, I created the project using Vite and React to improve  performance.
I created the main page and then created a card component to display the data.
Since the data comes with no images, I used a default image for all.

I created an .env file to hide the baseURL and placed the .env file in the gitignore for security.
I pushed the code to GitHub and imported it into the CodeSandbox.
